# Lockdown-Habits-Analysis-and-Consequences-on-Mental-Health
Project is based on a Kaggle dataset: "Covid-19 Survey Student Responses.

Data Analysis steps:
1. We performed different EDA techniques in order to get a better understanding of feature correlation to our target column, which was "Health issues during lockdown" (Did the subject develop any mental health issues.
2. We then validated the results with the research pinned in the Appendices Section.
3. We took the "Good Habits" such as Time spent on Fitness, Time spent on studying, etc, united them into a united-scaled column, and then we presented the differential in mental health issues development, associated with the average time per day spent on "Good Habits".(Such as mentioned above)
4. We then united screen related activities which studies says, promote development of poor communication, and later might influence mental health. We used the united feature again, in order to see how the average time is associated with mental health issues.
5. After reaching better understanding of the feautres, we developed a classification using Polynomial support vector machine. The recommended usage of the the model, is to conduct such survey in fixed time, and using the data recieved in order to predict which subjects might develop later mental and physical health issues. And thus, promote services to the specific subjects, and then hopefully, save lives and resources.
